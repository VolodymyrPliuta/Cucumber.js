         Given('the numbers {int} and {int}', function (int, int2) {
           // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
           return 'pending';
         });

    When they are added together

         When('they are added together', function () {
           // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
           return 'pending';
         });

    Then should the result be 5

         Then('should the result be {int}', function (int) {
           // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
           return 'pending';
